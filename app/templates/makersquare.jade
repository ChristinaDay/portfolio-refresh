      | MakerSquare is a coding bootcam that was aquired by
      a(href="www.hackreactor.com")  Hack Reactor
      |  last year. I crafted MakerSquareâ€™s branding as their Lead Designer in both Austin and San Francisco. In this role I developed their logo, designed and built the interior wall installations for their San Francisco location, developed a branding update and style guide in conjunction with the marketing team, crafted numerous fliers, business cards, letterheads and banners for the business and was involved critically in most design choices the company has made since its inception.
